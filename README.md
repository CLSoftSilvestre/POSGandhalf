## Sprint 1
Objective:
Our Customer “Gandalf Inc.” needs to implement a new POS solution. This customer has several stores where they sell a diversified range of necessity goods.
Each store needs to load data about stocks and prices from a central database to populate each store database with the goods for that specific store.
Right now, we need you to define and build the classes that we will need to implement the POS (Point-of-sale) application that will be installed in the several stores, to register all the sales.
Some of the rules that you need to consider:
- Each POS must have a login.
- Must allow register customer information data
- Cannot allow a sale if the stock is equal to Zero.
- Each sale is composed of one or multiple line of items
- Must save the total quantity of items per line
- Must save the total money amount per line
- Must save the product unit price
- Must save the order total: items quantity and money amount
- Must save the user that made the sale
- Must save date and time of the sale
- Must allow search products by name, brand and category.
- Before a sale is paid it must allow edit the quantity of products or delete lines
- Print a receipt after payment is done.
Use a console application to test your classes.

## Sprint 2
